Bug:
  the extension applies to all images, even if they're small, and it breaks in various circumstances (github for instance)

Bugfix:
  1. add Javascript
    1.1. list images
    1.2. on resize (with throttle)
      * remove class maximum-image-size-toobig
      * find only images that are higher/wider than viewport
      * give them a class maximum-image-size-toobig
  2. CSS
    replace `img` with `img.maximum-image-size-toobig`
